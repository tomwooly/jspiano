<b>Responsive Piano</b>

<b>Project Description</b>

This project is a responsive virtual piano created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play musical notes by clicking on the piano keys or using their keyboard. The piano keys respond in real-time, and the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

<b>Features</b>

Clickable Piano Keys: Users can play the piano by clicking on the keys with their mouse.

Volume Control: Users can adjust the volume of key strokes via the slider.

Keyboard Support: Play notes using specific keys on the keyboard.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for different devices and screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Real-Time Sound: Plays piano sounds without delay for an interactive experience.

<b>Technologies Used</b>

HTML5: For structuring the piano layout.

CSS3: For styling the piano keys and making the design responsive.

JavaScript: For managing sound playback and key event handling.

<b>How to Run the Project</b>

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/tomwooly/jspiano.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd responsive-piano

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to start playing the piano.

<b>Code Overview</b>

The project contains three main files:

index.html: Contains the structure of the piano interface.

style.css: Contains the styling for the piano layout and responsiveness.

script.js: Contains the JavaScript logic for sound handling, key event detection, and interactivity.

<b>Key JavaScript Logic</b>

Event Listeners: JavaScript listens for click events on the piano keys and keydown events from the keyboard.

Audio Playback: Each piano key is linked to an audio file that plays the corresponding note.

Responsiveness: The piano layout adjusts based on screen size to remain fully functional on mobile and tablet devices.

<b>Future Enhancements</b>

Record and Playback: Implement a feature to record and play back user-created melodies.

Multi-Key Press: Support for playing chords by allowing multiple key presses at once.
